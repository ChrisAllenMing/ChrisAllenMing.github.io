I was born in Shanghai, a fast-developing metropolis in China. 
Currently, I am a PhD student at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/),
advised by Prof. [Wentao Zhang](https://zwt233.github.io/) from PKU and Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) from Mila, 
where I focus on AI-guided Drug Discovery and building Biological Foundation Models. 
I am also a startup member of [BioGeometry](https://www.biogeom.com/), where we aim at facilitating Protein Design with Generative AI.

Previously, I received the Master and Bachelor degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Bingbing Ni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=eUbmKwYAAAAJ), where I research on transfer learning algorithms for object recognition and detection. 
During the period of Master study, I have a close collaboration with [Yuandong Tian](https://yuandong-tian.com/) and [Xinlei Chen](https://xinleic.xyz/) from Meta AI, [Hongyu Guo](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~hguo028/mainpage.htm) from National Research Council Canada, 
[Payel Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1vs31MgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Vijil Chenthamarakshan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g9hboJ0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Aurelie Lozano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4wTGaDsAAAAJ&hl=en) from IBM Research, and [Arian Jamasb](http://jamasb.io/) from University of Cambridge.

My current research focuses on:

- Facilitating protein design and optimization with generative AI
- Understanding the functional roles of biomolecules with geometric deep learning
- Building biological foundation models incorporating different biological entities (genes, proteins, cells and tissues)

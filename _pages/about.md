I was born in Shanghai, a fast-developing metropolis in China. Currently, I am a second year master student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Bingbing Ni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=eUbmKwYAAAAJ), 
where I focus on developing transfer learning algorithms for object recognition and detection. Also, I am a research assistant at [Mila (Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms)](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) and [Hongyu Guo](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~hguo028/mainpage.htm),
where I research on graph representation learning algorithms. Before that, I receive the Bachelor degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), SJTU.

My current research interests lie in:

- Learning informative and interpretable representations for molecular/general graphs
- Object recognition/detection model's transferability across different domains 
- Relational reasoning for visual/graph entities

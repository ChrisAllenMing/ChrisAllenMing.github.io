# Minghao's Homepage

This repository maintains the project files of Minghao's Homepage.

I would like to appreciate the academic page template provided by [this excellent work](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which is forked (and then detached) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

## Develop upon this project

1. Fork this repository.

2. Rename it "yourusername.github.io".
 * Do this in the settings menu (top right, below watch/star/fork buttons).
 * Check it is running in the "Github Pages" section of the settings page.

3. Update variables in ```_config.yml``` to match your site.
 * URL is especially important.
 
4. Update files in ```./_pages/``` directory to set top-level.

5. Update/delete sample files for different kinds of collections 
 * The files for each item are in ```./_talks/```, ```./_teaching/```, ```./_publications/```, ```./_portfolio/```, and ```./_posts/``` for each item in these collections.
 * Delete the sample files (no need to delete the directory) if you do not want a kind of collection in your site.

6. Update top menu bar (to add/remove items) by editing ```./_data/navigation.yml```.

7. Run ```talkmap.ipynb``` (must have repository cloned) to generate talkmap.
